<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Silviu! I'm from Cluj-Napoca, Romania - a dynamic city in the northern
  part of the country. I have a background in engineering with expertise in
  software development, integration, verification, and validation. I have a
  bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Technical University of
  Cluj-Napoca. I can say that I have the word <em>"tech"</em> in my blood. :)

<p>
  I am a hard worker skilled in problem-solving and time management. I take
  initiative and get things done on my own as well as with others within the
  team. I catch on quickly and enjoy continuously learn new skills.

  I was born in a blessed mountain area where I was raised with a strong
  connection to nature. I volunteered for an ECO Club starting from elementary
  school which kicked off a hobby. Yes, you got it... I like to spend as much
  time as needed in nature, engaging in hiking or trekking activities. Over
  time, I discovered a passion for mushrooms, and I enjoy searching for them in
  the woods. On the other hand, when the weather is not very pleasant, I spend
  time indoors on a sofa, sipping from a cup of tea and enjoying either an
  adventure book or a tech one (depending on the day). I am a fan of retro
  consoles and games, especially the Japanese ones. I am nostalgic, you could
  say. :)
